// General note: in the Cedar gRPC protocol, the client is a user interface
// realized as a web app or a mobile app. The client interacts with the
// server via gRPC, using the messages and RPCs defined in this proto file.
//
// The server runs independently of the client. In particular, image
// acquisitions, star extractions, plate solving, and updates of SkySafari occur
// in the server even if no user interface app is connected. A client can obtain
// FrameResults at a rate equal to or slower than the rate at which the server
// is producing results.
//
// Note also that multiple clients can be connected to the same server, in which
// case each client can independenly obtain its own sequence of FrameResults
// without affecting the FrameResults seen by other clients (in other words, if
// client A obtains a FrameResult X, it is not "consumed", so client B can
// obtain the same FrameResult X). However, if any client updates the operating
// mode or settings of the server, this will be visible to all clients.
//
// Finally, note Cedar's integration with SkySafari is a protocol separate from
// the gRPC protocol defined in this proto file. Similarly, Cedar's gRPC
// integration with Tetra3 is described in a separate proto file.
