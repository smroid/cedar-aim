show matches/pattern stars in operate mode. Except when slewing?
* make this a preference, is ugly

* enlarge display text (check on phone)

reorganize 'cedar' repo to:
* cedar-server
* cedar-aim

auto-detect alt-az vs equatorial (with manual override)

alert icon if observer location not yet set.

calibrate for match_max_error

change license for Cedar Aim (server & app) to AGPL or negotiated.

Remove refresh rate control. Go full speed; when dwelling for more than N
seconds drop to 5hz.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing image

eq vs alt/az setting
* alt/az prompts for observer location if not known -- don't bother?
* convey to SkySafari

Support Stellarium telescope control

Cedar Pole Align
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?

status LED
* cedar server liveness
* wifi connection status
* setting to turn off (ephemeral)

Physical button
* power-off?
* switch wifi mode?

create Android app
create IOS app
* benefits (for both): control over screen rotation; access to location info; switching
  app to SkySafari?
* control over wifi?

Cedar Journal
* capture Cedar Sky goto requests (and whether target was reached)
* capture RA/DEC when long-enough dwell detected
TBD

Lens heater with slider control

Cedar Sky
Idea: OOBE should not require Sky Safari integration
* rudimentary catalog of "beginner" objects
  - brightness
  - size
  - object type (bright star, planet, nebula, double star, open cluster,
    globular cluster, galaxy)
* slider for brightness limit
* selector boxes for object types
* display selected objects in FOV. Tap to bring up info and goto button.
* option for whole-sky (more than 5deg above current horizon) vs. near (within 45deg)
  current boresight (ranked by distance). Maybe a slider, with far setting being
  whole sky.
* ephemeris for planets/asteroids
* cloud-enabled: comets, other interlopers

Goto ra/dec button: pops up text entry field

remote ops, proxied via phone
* update cedar server
* download logs
* send bug reports

"expert" mode enable
* focus inset enable/disable (hopper is pre-focused)
* RMSE display
* eq/alt-az selector; auto checkbox
* polar alignment advice
* speed-quality slider
* option to show exposure control
* option to show stats
* re-align in target slew
* ra/dec formatting option
* refresh rate control
* FOV control
* capture image
* show detected/solved stars option
* dark calibration
* show server log

CPU temperature

bug report

.local dns entry -- already done for us by rpi os?

interoperation with SkySafari
* switch apps?
* split screen?
* picture-in-picture?

help system
* long press? (GestureDetector wrapped around a widget)
* 'i' icons?

make more settings durable
* accuracy slider
* update rates

vignetting calibration

Wifi management
* access point, provisioning
* switching wifi mode-- setting in web UI?
* bluetooth? disable if not using?
* access point power level (save battery)

FITS support for saved images? Other formats?

logging
* observer log is separate

command line options for camera binning: yes, no, auto.

motion classification
* adjust update interval

UI:
* operation controls
  - save image: add confirmation+rename

Preferences:
* update rate (non-dwell, dwell)
* flip options? To match telescope FOV orientation.
  - sync with SkySafari?

Dark calibration:
* hot pixel map
* obtain pattern noise to improve star detection

About page

Help page
* mostly redirects attention to long-press aids?

Sounds for various actions/events in app?
