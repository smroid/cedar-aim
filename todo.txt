show matches/pattern stars in operate mode. Except when slewing?
* make this a preference, is ugly

darken screen surround

Force landscape option

outline border around inset image (setup mode; target slew mode)

eliminate first setting on speed/quality slider.

investigate initial large residual when starting a motion track

* enlarge display text (check on phone)

Slewing to target:
* when slew target is off-screen, add axis movement prompts in large font
* when slew target is on-screen, blink it
* when slew target is in magnified reticle, make the target cross's gap larger
* offer 'align to target' button: user acquires target in telescope FOV, centers
  it, and then hits 'align to target' button to update the boresight alignment.

Pacifier/busy indicator for capturing image

align/accumulate images? Write out image at end of dwell to observing log?

eq vs alt/az setting
* alt/az prompts for observer location if not known -- don't bother?
* convey to SkySafari

polar alignment
* top-level mode?
* alert if no observer location
* alert if not tracking mount (or not roughly polar aligned)
* guidance for where to point scope
* king method?
